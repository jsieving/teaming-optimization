# teaming-optimization
Final project for Discrete Math, Fall 2021 @ Olin College.

## Usage
Requires `pandas`.

Run `python main.py` to run the program on sample student survey data.

### On your own survey data

TBD: Make it more user friendly to use this algorithm on your own survey results.

## What's where

`assignments.py` - Algorithms that take in a list of students and produce a team assignment go here. \
`data_loader.py` - Imports data from survey results and converts it to Students. \
`helpers.py` - Miscellaneous methods that might be useful in multiple contexts. \
`main.py` - Runs the things. \
`scoring.py` - Functions for scoring team assignments on different metrics go here. \
`student.py` - The Student class.
